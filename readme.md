# NeuroLearn – AI-Powered Educational Platform for Neurodivergent Learners

NeuroLearn is an inclusive educational platform tailored for neurodivergent individuals, such as those with dyslexia or autism. It leverages the power of AI to break down complex concepts into digestible, bite-sized pieces and enriches learning with visuals, and progress tracking. Each completed module earns the learner a verifiable certificate powered by blockchain.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **AI Content Breakdown**: Breaks down large content into readable summaries.
- 🧠 **Neurodiversity-Friendly UI**: Clean, minimal, and distraction-free design.
- 📊 **Progress Tracker**: Learners see how far they’ve come and what’s next.
- 🏆 **Web3 Certification**: Skill badges and certificates minted as NFTs to verify learning on-chain.
- 🎨 **Visual Support**: Concepts explained using illustrations and interactive elements.

## 💡 SDG Alignment

This project aligns with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
- **SDG 4 – Quality Education**: Promotes inclusive and equitable education for all.
- **SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities**: Addresses learning accessibility for neurodivergent individuals.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: OpenAI API / HuggingFace for content summarization
- **Backend**: Python
- **Blockchain/Web3**: Ethereum (EVM), NFT.storage/IPFS for certificates
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Others**: Git, GitHub, Vercel/Netlify

## 📦 Features

- 📚 AI-generated learning modules
- 📷 Visual aids for concept explanation
- 🧾 NFT-based skill certificate (via smart contract)


## ⛓ How It Works (Web3 Layer)

1. User completes a skill module.
2. Certificate metadata (name, module name, date) is minted as an NFT.
3. NFT is stored on IPFS and tied to user's wallet.
4. DAO members can vote on adding new modules or upgrades.
